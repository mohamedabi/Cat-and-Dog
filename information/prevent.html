<p>In order to make tampering easier and you are witnessing it, it is best to capture the beast - the injuries, the conditions in which it lives, the overall and detailed view of the animal, and other shots that might help solve the problem. It is advisable to have witnesses (at least one). Of course, it is essential to report every case of abuse, even if you do not have all of this information or photographic documentation.
	<br><br>By law, the staff of the shelter can not arbitrarily enter the land of the pet owner and take it out of bad conditions, for which it is the competent authority of the RVPS.<br><br>
	RVPS - Regional Veterinary and Food Administration, which may, after investigating the case, impose remedies or prohibit rearing. A private individual may impose a fine of up to EUR 300 and a legal entity raising up to EUR 16,500. According to the Criminal Code, it is possible to impose a custodial sentence of 2 years on the animal abuses.
