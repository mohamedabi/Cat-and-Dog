	<h5>Prepare in advance</h5>
<p>
We recommend that you prepare your prenatal adoption - it is good to prepare the wound or the place to sleep, the bowl ... the dog will help you get used to the new environment faster and will not be as disoriented as if you were all changed after his arrival.</p>

		<h5>Fix the fence</h5>
		<p>
If you have a dog in the garden, check that you do not have a hoe in the fence or other deficiency that would allow him to easily escape. Some dogs have a tendency to flee from the beginning until they find that it is their new home, so it is better not to give them a chance.
<h5>Do not leave your dog alone</h5>
<p>
In the first days do not leave your dog alone - especially if you live in a flat. Prepare for it - you go first only for a quarter of an hour, then on the pole and later on for a long time. The dog may be surprised to have left him and can start scratching the door or destroying the furniture in order to get out. But if you learn that you will always come back, he will be happy and wait for you.</p>
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>
Remember that the dog must be vaccinated again every year (vaccination against rabies is mandatory by law) and degrading every quarter of the year. Many dogs have to be cut several times a year, regularly cut out. Do not forget to cut ribbons, clean ears and tartar.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">What to do when a dog loses and what to do to get rid of it?</h6>
<p>Do not give up when your dog is lost. Find him!<br>
Contact all shelters in your area. Best to do when you go looking in person - sometimes the dog's description over the phone is not sufficient and accurate and can come to an unwanted error.<br>
Also contact the city police in your town (often it is being captured).<br>
Put an ad in local newspapers - best with a photo of a dog.<br> 
Tell your neighbors, you know, ask around, untie the plagues with the photo, the dog's description and your contact, ...<br>
And when you find your dog, give him a collar and a label with your name and phone number on it. If someone finds it, he will be able to return it immediately and will not have to wait until he finds it yourself. The dog will speed up his return to you.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">What to do if a dog is found?</h6>
<p>If you happen to see a dog without the owner on the street, it's likely he's lost. In that case he needs help. But it also happens that the dog has just taken off and his owner is just around the corner or sitting on a bench nearby. Therefore, before contacting a shelter or city police, check whether the dog is actually abandoned or lost. If you have completed this, do not hesitate to dial the shelter number (in your town) or, if you have the option, you can bring the dog directly to the shelter.<br>
It may happen that you will find an animal that is injured and needs immediate veterinary help. It is best then to bring him to the nearest vet immediately - this is his greatest help.<br>
If you find a different animal than a dog that moves freely and you feel it needs your help, it is better to contact the local shelter beforehand and, after they have agreed to bring the animal. It is a fact that people bring puppies that have their parents only for a moment, or capture animals that have no opportunity or reason to live in a shelter.</p>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Puppy or adult dog? How to decide?</h6>
<p>Note that the arrival of a puppy, in addition to joy, brings with you some changes in your life. Often, puppy behavior can be compared with the behavior of young children. Consider whether you are ready for this or you prefer a chance to an adult. Sure, puppies are fascinating, but even older dogs have their advantages. And most importantly: you can take a walk with him right away, or he can play the role of the guardian of your home right now, he has a basic education, you do not have to teach him everything from the beginning. Especially the elderly people can get tired of their inconvenient puppies and therefore we would recommend a older dog. However, if you decide for a puppy, you need to find enough time, the first period you will have to be 24 hours a day to create a good relationship and master the education.</p>
