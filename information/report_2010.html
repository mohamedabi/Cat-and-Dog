<h3 style="text-align: center; color: #2e6ebc;">How to help us </h3><br>
<p>     We built the 2010 budget very cautiously, expecting lower incomes from donors as a result of the crisis. Unfortunately, our concerns have not been fulfilled, our sympathizers, animal lovers have supported us all year round with financial gifts, feeds, blankets, carpets and lots of other things necessary for animals. Thanks to them, we were able to make further major repairs and modifications to the shelter in order to improve the comfort and safety of the animals.
</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">FARMING</h6><br>
<p>Revenues from donations and contributions were over 41,000. € <br>
from the share of income tax paid € 20,529.46 <br>
from the provision of services on the basis of contracts with towns and municipalities 18.2 thousand. € 
(of which City Piešťany 16 597 €), <br>
from support for activation work from ÚPRaso 6.5 thous. € 
from the subsidy of the City of Piešťany 500 €, together nearly 86 thous. € .<br><br>
Expenditures amounted to approx . € , so the management can be considered balanced. Year-end liabilities of 5.2 thousand. €. are covered by the funds on the account.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">PERSONAL SECURITY</h6>
<p>     In 2010, we were more able to use the state and the European Union offered assistance in the form of activation workers, as is evident from the contribution from the Center for Revenue and Utilities, presented in part of revenues. Especially at the end of the year, these workers formed a team that significantly improved animal care. It remains to be hoped that this assistance will also be provided at other times as it is a prerequisite for the operation of the shelter. The volunteers who help with their abilities and possibilities and who sacrifice their free time and energy for the animals themselves and for love are a great help for the shelter. They arrive in the late afternoon and evening hours at the shelter to allow the animals to "expel" the drug, to check if they are okay. Others work from home, even from another city, providing home care. Others regularly help in stock exchanges, It is a great help to set up a Facebook that our Sympathicist from Bratislava leads with great ingenuity. The only reward for all these people is the feeling that the animals are secure, healthy, healthy, and most likely in a new, loving home.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">MATERIAL EQUIPMENT</h6>
<p>     As soon as January, Lexan was set up on the cooler and the quarantine quarantined to prevent the dogs from being protected from snow and wind. In March and April, the dangerous tiles were replaced by concrete pavements alongside the cotercoats, the floor was laid in the social room, the deadlocks were repaired on the shelter between the cells, the areas under the garage and the quarters were being quarried in the quarantine area and in front of the premises, - raw and unimobuniek. A complete reconstruction of the work was done also with coats of roofs and unimobuniek - for this work the City of Piešťany provided a subsidy of 500 €. In May, the work was weather-proof - heavy rain with a strong wind would have sparked the entire process, which would have resulted in great damage to property and possibly human and animal health. In May, new lattice grilles were installed on windows and doors of unimobuniek, a waste pipe was installed on the front premises. During the summer months, maintenance and repairs were carried out by our own staff. In August, the company has made new walls in quarantine in the quarantine (already third during their lifetime), as the old ones were already dangerous for animals.
<br>
At the end of August, we handed over 20 cartons of necessary items from donations from foreign partners to the collection for people affected by floods organized by the church. In November, Mr. Hatal's firm has produced a new non-stopper for two dogs and has repaired a sewer. We have received as a gift the beautiful trees that we have planted and hope to provide animals with the necessary shade in summer heat. At the end of the year, we still managed to make 10 insulated bows for 20 dogs to replace old, bruised and destroyed. All work cost us more than 13 ths. €.<br><br>
Our plans for some of the bigger jobs and the new unimobunku remained unfulfilled. Unfortunately, we do not have enough money. However, we believe that what we did not succeed in 2010 is being successfully implemented with the help of our donors in the coming years.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">VETERINARY TREATMENT</h6>
<p>     The cost of veterinary treatment exceeded all current limits in 2010, reaching a height of over 21 thousand. €. Besides the reasons we have already explained in the annual reports of previous years, we have caused an increase of approx. € chip purchase for nationwide chipping of animals, which we started in the end of last year. We believe that this step will contribute in particular to the discovery of irresponsible owners and thus to the decrease in the number of abandoned and abused animals. In cooperation with the Lower Silesian Region, we continue the effort to reduce the number of unwanted youngsters by sterilization and sterilization of all animals, allowing for their age and health. Not every adopter approves this action, but we do not see another humane way of solving a problem that the competent authorities have ignored for at least twenty years. Of the animals we have taken to the shelter, were in 2010 sterilized, respectively. castrated 156 dogs and 23 cats. In 2010 we received 557 animals, of which 469 dogs and 88 cats. Of this number, 61 animals returned to their original owners, 16 died and 13 were euthanized. The remaining 449 animals, of which 392 dogs and 57 cats, came to new homes.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">COOPERATION WITH FOREIGNERS</h6>
<p>     We are delighted that cooperation with foreign partners, individuals and protection groups from Austria and Germany continues and our partners from older times are returning to us, who have encouraged positive changes in the shelter to work together. An important act is to include our shelter in the TR @ CES Internet system, which creates a network between the veterinary authorities of the EU Member States and economic operators with Decision 2002/459 / EC. Animals leaving our shelter abroad are registered in this system, which was created to protect, track, record and target the illegal export of animals.

<p>     The Dogs Crossbreed Competition Piešťanský 2010 was again held in early September, but the weather did not happen to us.Napriek small, persistent rain the participation of dogs was decent and the prices were very nice. Contesting dogs showed a whole range of abilities, not even dogdancing. The audience's response was, as always, warm.
